#Career Finder
#Stiff Triangles
##The problem is many people, whether they are young or not, have a difficult time finding a career or potential fields they could be interested in. Because of this, they often don't know what to search for them when they are curious about the various career fields in the world.
##Our final project is an easy solution to this problem because it is a compelling and fun method for everyone to find a few potential careers without the stress of researching and deciding their careers.
##An interactive survey/game on the web to help you determine multiple possible careers in the future along with some information on how to get involved in these different fields listed in the results.
### The languages we used to make this website are html to create the basic components, and css to design the way the components from our html code would look.
###The basic features we would like our project to have would be interactive buttons and photos, a navigation bar with functional pages linked to it, and the basic test along with its results.
### Our stretch goals would be to make our site more visually compelling and fun for the users with animations.
